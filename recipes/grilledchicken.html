        <h1>San Diego Grilled Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../recipes/chicken.jpeg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a Southern California version of sweet and sour chicken, marinated and grilled with a little extra spice. Great for all barbeque lovers. I usually serve cut into lengths with fresh cilantro, homemade salsa, guacamole, black beans, and flour tortillas warmed on the grill. A little good Southern California karma never hurts anyone. This recipe is light enough to offset the first 2 margaritas. GO CHARGERS!! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 oranges, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>2 lemons, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>2 limes, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>  
            <li>¼ cup wildflower honey</li> 
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to about 3/4-inch thickness </li>  
            <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>  
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the orange zest, orange juice, lemon zest, lemon juice, lime zest, lime juice, coriander, red pepper flakes, olive oil, and honey together in a shallow dish. Remove about 1/4 cup of the mixture and set aside for later. Add the chicken breasts to the remaining marinade, turning to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, turning occasionally, 1 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade; discard the marinade.</li>
       <li>Basting frequently with the reserved sauce, cook the chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li> 
    </ol>
